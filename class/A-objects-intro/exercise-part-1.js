Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
var car = {
    brand: "Seat",
    model: "Arona",
    color: "white",
    horsepower: 115,
    doors: 5
};

*/

 var smartphone = {
     brand: "Xiaomi",
     camera: 16,
     ram: 4,
     rom: 64,
     model: "Redmi Note 5",
     color: "black" 
 };

 console.log(smartphone);
